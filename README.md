# Pomodoro Timer

I just want a simple Pomodoro timer for my Ubuntu box so here it is. 

`gnome-pomodoro` takes up too much desktop space and is too 'complex' for my needs :)

## Use
Open a terminal then copy and paste the commands below.  

```bash
wget https://github.com/jachermocilla/pomodoro/releases/latest/pomodoro-timer_1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./pomodoro-timer_1.0.1_amd64.deb

```

Search for the app in the app list after.
