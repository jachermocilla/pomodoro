# Pomodoro Timer

I just want a simple Pomodoro timer for my Linux box so here it is. 

`gnome-pomodoro` takes up too much desktop space and is too 'complex' for my needs :)

## Use
On the terminal: 

```bash
wget https://github.com/jachermocilla/pomodoro/releases/download/v1.0.0/pomodoro-timer_1.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./pomodoro-timer_1.0.0_amd64.deb

```

Search for the app in the app list.
